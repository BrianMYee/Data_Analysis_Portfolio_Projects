/* For this Data Analysis we will be using Data pulled from Zillow to compare Housing Prices in the state of North Carolina over the last 5 years by County.  We will also be looing at Rental prices and comparing the two.

I will be pulling the ZHVI Single-Family Homes Time Series ($) file by County from the Home Values section as well at the ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus MultiFamily Time Series ($) by County from the Rentals section.

This data is located here: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

I will be using SQLite on the DB Browser

--Name Tables NC_SFH_County_Month and NC_County_Rental
*/ First let's explore the data a bit */

SELECT *
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month
WHERE Statename <> 'NC'

-- We have a lot of Data that we can ignore for out NC only Analysis.  Let's change that to a Delete statement and remove this data.

DELETE 
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month
WHERE Statename <> 'NC'

-- We should be left with only the NC Data (NC has 100 Counties, so you should be left with 100 rows of data.)

SELECT *
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month

--  Now let's follow the same process for the Rental information

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental
WHERE Statename <> 'NC'

-- As before there is a lot of non NC data we can remove

DELETE
FROM NC_County_Rental
WHERE Statename <> 'NC'

-- The non NC data should be gone now

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental

-- Only NC Data remains, but it looks like we have many less rows in this data.  That's odd-  maybe Zillow does not track as many counties for Rental data as they do for single family homes.To be sure, let's check the raw data and count the counties selected-  3079(Single Family Homes) vs 1068(Rentals). So we have confiremd that the Datasets do not match regarding counties-  Maybe we should narrow our datasets to select counties since we cannot compare statewide data.  Let's check the top 10 counties from each dataset and see if the match.  We will use the 'SizeRank' column to select the most populous counties from each.

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental
WHERE StateName = 'NC'
ORDER BY SizeRank ASC
LIMIT 10

-- The Top 10 counties  Wake, Mecklenburg, Guilford, Forsyth, Cumberland, Durham, Buncombe, Union, Gaston, and New Hanover counties according to the Rental (NC_County_Rental) data.  Let's check the Single Family Home data (NC_SFH_County_Month) to see if they match.

SELECT *
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month
WHERE StateName = 'NC'
ORDER BY SizeRank ASC
LIMIT 10

-- So the counties match according to the data in the SizeRank column.  Good news since we can at least compare the largest counties with each other from the two datasets.  I am curious to push this data to the top 13 counties since I currently live in the one that appears 13th in the SizeRank column. We can use an INNER JOIN to see this data.

SELECT NC_County_Rental.RegionName, NC_SFH_County_Month.RegionName
FROM NC_County_Rental
INNER JOIN NC_SFH_County_Month
ON NC_County_Rental.RegionID = NC_SFH_County_Month.RegionID
ORDER BY NC_SFH_County_Month.SizeRank
Limit 13

-- It looks like the Top 13 counties also match on both datasets which is good for our later analysis.  Let's open this data up a bit to look at more of the actual Rental monetary data included.

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental
INNER JOIN NC_SFH_County_Month
ON NC_County_Rental.RegionID = NC_SFH_County_Month.RegionID
ORDER BY NC_SFH_County_Month.SizeRank
Limit 13

-- By glancing at some of this data we can see that there ar many NULL points of data.  It looks like Zillow was not collecting Single Family Home data for some of these counties until some point in 2005 and it looks.  That doesn't matter so much since we are only interested in the last 5 years.  It is a bit hard to comb through all of this data though having so many columns-  there is a column for rental/more prices for every month for over 20 years in some cases.  To eliminate the unnecessary data we are actually going to delete these columns by going to the Database stucture tab in the DB Browser for SQLite to delete the unecessary data.  We only want to keep the months from 08/2021 through 07/2023 so we can have 5 years worth of data for each table.  There is another way to DROP specific columns that you don't need, and now that we have gotten rid of the months, let's 'drop' a redundant column.  It looks like the values for State and StateName are exactly the same, and since we are now limited to NC data, let's drop the Statename column from the tables.

ALTER TABLE NC_County_Rental
DROP COLUMN StateName

SELECT * 
FROM NC_County_Rental

--  It looks like we dropped the StateName column successfully.  Let's do the other table now.

ALTER TABLE NC_SFH_County_Month
DROP COLUMN StateName

SELECT * 
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month

-- We got rid of the extra months and the redundant column we didn't need through 2 different methods.  Let's also limit the rows needed to just the 13 counties we want to compare.  First let's verify the number of counties in each table.

SELECT COUNT(SizeRank)
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month

--As we stated earlier, there are 100 counties and it looks like Zillow does collect data for all of these counties for Single Family Homes, so our output of 100 makes sense.  We can delete the bottom 87 counties since we no longer need them.  I am going to run the same code, but first as a SELECT statement to see what we will be deleting, and then as a DELETE statement to make it final.

SELECT *
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month
WHERE State = 'NC'
ORDER BY SizeRank DESC
LIMIT 87

--  Ok, data looks good.  None of our core counties are included-  let's proceed to deleting it.  You need to alter the statement a bit to SELECT which counties to delete.  We can see if we run the SizeRank query that Onslow County (The smallest and last county in our list) has a size ranking of 338.  We can create a statement whereby all counties with a SizeRank greater than 338 will be deleted.

DELETE 
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month
WHERE SizeRank > '338'

--  Our NC_SFH_County_Month Table now only contains the 13 counties we want.  Let's do the same for the Rental table now.

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental
WHERE SizeRank > '338'
-- These are not the counties we want, let's proceed to DELETE.

DELETE 
FROM NC_County_Rental
Where SizeRank > '338'

-- Now let's verify our Data.

SELECT *
FROM NC_County_Rental;

SELECT * 
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month;

--Data looks much better! At this point though there may be an obstacle you can run into with the data as it currently exists.  Let's try to compute an AVG value of one of the rental or home value columns and see what happens.  Let's use the home value since the result will be more obvious.

SELECT AVG (2023-07-31)
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month

--  Hmmmm..... The output tells us that the average single family home in our selected 13 counties in July 2023 is only $1985!!!  That can't be, but our code looks right and returned no errors.  What could be going on here?  If he take the column name for the month we used- it is written as a math expression might be written "2023-7-31".  So what would 2023-38(the 7 plus the 31) be in math? It would be 1985.  The column name can be written appended with the backtick symbol ` as such '2023-07-31` and now the SQL code will read it as a column name and not as a math expression.  Let's try.

SELECT AVG (`2023-07-31`)
FROM NC_SFH_County_Month

--  Output = $352,235.37(I manually rounded, but you can ROUND in SQL as well!) That looks more accurate for an average Single Family Home value.
